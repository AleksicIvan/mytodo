# mytodo

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.11.1. I have merely typed into the Atom and appropriate files.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.

## Important Note

Developing this  app in ubuntu 15.10 Wily Werevolf was quite a challange, especially setting up dev enivronment. So, for future references, a note to myself:
1.Install node and npm without sudo
2.Change ownership for the files created when above app-s were installed (from root to sudo)
3.In your_app fokder install Grunt locally
4.Install angular and karma generators
5.Cd to your_app and run Yo
6.Follow up the console and watch for errors/dependencies missing
7.Never got to run Bootstrap and jquery through Bower, instead added them from CDN
8.Had some problems with imagemin
9.In Windows (using cmder) everything went much smoother
